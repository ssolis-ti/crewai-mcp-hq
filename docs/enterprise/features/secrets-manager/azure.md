Configure Azure Key Vault as a secret provider for CrewAI Platform, end-to-end


## 

​

Overview

This guide walks you through configuring Azure Key Vault as a secret provider for your CrewAI Platform organization, using a **Microsoft Entra App Registration with a client secret**. By the end, CrewAI Platform will be able to read secrets stored in your Azure Key Vault and inject them as environment variable values at runtime.

This guide covers the **static credentials** path — secrets are resolved at deploy time and baked into the deployment image. Rotated values require a re-deploy. If you want rotation-aware secrets that update on every automation kickoff, see [Azure Workload Identity Federation](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/azure-workload-identity).

This guide covers the Azure-side configuration and the credential setup in CrewAI Platform. To then reference a secret from an environment variable, see [Using the Secrets Manager](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/usage).

## 

​

Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

  * An Azure subscription with permission to create App Registrations in Microsoft Entra and to grant role assignments on Key Vault resources.
  * A Key Vault using **Azure RBAC** for authorization (not the legacy access-policy model). If your vault still uses access policies, switch it to RBAC under the vault’s **Access configuration** blade.
  * A CrewAI Platform organization where your user has the `secret_providers: manage` permission. See [Permissions (RBAC)](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/usage#permissions-rbac).

## 

​

Step 1 — Create an App Registration

The App Registration is the Microsoft Entra-side identity CrewAI Platform will authenticate as. In the [Microsoft Entra portal](https://entra.microsoft.com), navigate to **App registrations** and click **New registration**.

  * **Name:** `crewai-secrets-reader`
  * **Supported account types:** `Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)`.
  * Leave **Redirect URI** blank.

Click **Register**. Note the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** on the App’s overview blade — you’ll paste both into CrewAI Platform in Step 4. For full details, see the Microsoft documentation: [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).

## 

​

Step 2 — Create a Client Secret

On the App Registration, navigate to **Certificates & secrets** → **Client secrets** → **New client secret**.

  * **Description:** `crewai-platform`
  * **Expires:** pick a duration that matches your rotation policy (Microsoft caps this at 24 months).

Click **Add**. Copy the **Value** column immediately — it can never be re-displayed once you leave the page.

Client secrets are long-lived static credentials. Store the value securely (in a password manager or your own secret store) and rotate it before expiry. To eliminate static credentials entirely, use [Azure Workload Identity Federation](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/azure-workload-identity) instead.

## 

​

Step 3 — Grant the App Registration Access to Key Vault

CrewAI Platform needs read access to secrets in your Key Vault. Use one of two scopes — **vault-wide** for simplicity, or **per-secret** for least privilege.

  * Vault-wide (simpler)

  * Per-secret (least privilege)

In the [Key Vault console](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.KeyVault%2Fvaults), open the target vault, then navigate to **Access control (IAM)** → **Add** → **Add role assignment**.

  * **Role:** **Key Vault Secrets User**
  * **Assign access to:** User, group, or service principal
  * **Members:** search for and select your App Registration (`crewai-secrets-reader`).

Click **Review + assign**.Or via the Azure CLI:
    
    
    az role assignment create \
      --assignee <APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID> \
      --role "Key Vault Secrets User" \
      --scope $(az keyvault show --name <VAULT_NAME> --query id -o tsv)
    

Grant the role at the level of an individual secret. Repeat for each secret CrewAI Platform should access:
    
    
    az role assignment create \
      --assignee <APPLICATION_CLIENT_ID> \
      --role "Key Vault Secrets User" \
      --scope $(az keyvault secret show --vault-name <VAULT_NAME> --name <SECRET_NAME> --query id -o tsv)
    

The **Key Vault Secrets User** role allows reading secret values but not listing all secrets in the vault. CrewAI Platform’s secret-name autocomplete also calls `list` — that permission is included by the role at the vault scope, but **not** at the per-secret scope. With per-secret bindings, autocomplete won’t suggest secrets; type the full secret name instead.

## 

​

Step 4 — Add the Credential in CrewAI Platform

In CrewAI Platform, navigate to **Settings** → **Secret Provider Credentials** and click **Add Credential**. Fill the form:

  * **Name:** A descriptive name, e.g. `azure-prod`.
  * **Provider:** `Azure Key Vault`.
  * **Key Vault URL:** the vault’s DNS hostname, e.g. `https://my-vault.vault.azure.net`.
  * **Tenant ID:** your Microsoft Entra **Directory (tenant) ID** from Step 1.
  * **Client ID:** your App Registration’s **Application (client) ID** from Step 1.
  * **Client Secret:** the **Value** you copied in Step 2.
  * (Optional) Check **Set as default credential for this provider**. The default credential is used by environment variables that reference Azure secrets without specifying a credential explicitly.

Click **Create**.

## 

​

Step 5 — Create at Least One Secret in Azure Key Vault

If you don’t already have secrets in Key Vault, create one now so you can verify the connection in Step 6. In the Key Vault console, navigate to **Objects** → **Secrets** → **Generate/Import**.

  * **Upload options:** `Manual`
  * **Name:** e.g. `openai-api-key`
  * **Secret value:** paste your secret value
  * Leave the rest at defaults.

Click **Create**. Or via the Azure CLI:
    
    
    az keyvault secret set \
      --vault-name <VAULT_NAME> \
      --name openai-api-key \
      --value "sk-your-actual-key"
    

**Secret name conventions.** Azure Key Vault secret names cannot contain underscores. CrewAI Platform automatically converts underscores to hyphens when calling Azure (e.g., `db_password` is sent as `db-password`), so you can keep underscore-style env-var names — but the underlying secret in Key Vault must use hyphens.

**JSON-key reference syntax.** Key Vault treats secret values as opaque strings. If your secret value happens to be a JSON object, CrewAI Platform can extract a single field using the `secret-name#json_key` syntax (e.g. `database-credentials#password`). See [Using the Secrets Manager](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/usage#referencing-secrets-in-environment-variables) for details.

For full details, see the Microsoft documentation: [Set and retrieve a secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-cli).

## 

​

Step 6 — Test the Connection

Back in CrewAI Platform, on the **Secret Provider Credentials** page, find the credential you just created and click **Test Connection**. A success toast confirms that CrewAI Platform can authenticate to Microsoft Entra and read secrets from your vault. If the test fails, check the most common causes:

Symptom| Likely cause  
---|---  
`AADSTS7000215: Invalid client secret provided`| The pasted **Client Secret** is wrong or expired. Re-create the secret (Step 2) and update the credential.  
`AADSTS700016: Application not found in the directory`| The **Tenant ID** or **Client ID** doesn’t match the App Registration. Re-check Step 4.  
`Forbidden — caller does not have permission`| The App Registration is missing the **Key Vault Secrets User** role on the vault (or per-secret). Re-check Step 3.  
`Vault not found` / DNS errors| The **Key Vault URL** is wrong, or your vault has private endpoints that block public access. Confirm the host responds to `curl https://<vault-name>.vault.azure.net/secrets?api-version=7.4`.  
`Forbidden — request was not authorized` (vault using legacy access policies)| The vault hasn’t been switched to Azure RBAC. Under the vault’s **Access configuration** , set permission model to **Azure role-based access control** and re-grant the role from Step 3.

​

Next Steps

Now that Azure Key Vault is connected, head to [Using the Secrets Manager](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/usage) to:

  * Grant org members the right permissions to use (or manage) Secrets Manager.
  * Reference your Azure secrets from CrewAI Platform environment variables.

If you want **rotation-aware** secrets that propagate without re-deploying, switch to [Azure Workload Identity Federation](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/azure-workload-identity) — same vault, no client secret to rotate, secrets are fetched per kickoff.
