Triggers

# OneDrive Trigger


Automate responses to OneDrive file activity


## 

​

Overview

Start automations when files change inside OneDrive. You can generate audit summaries, notify security teams about external sharing, or update downstream line-of-business systems with new document metadata.

Connect OneDrive in **Tools & Integrations** and toggle the trigger on for your deployment.

## 

​

Enabling the OneDrive Trigger

  1. Open your deployment in CrewAI AMP
  2. Go to the **Triggers** tab
  3. Locate **OneDrive** and switch the toggle to enable

## 

​

Example: Audit file permissions
    
    
    from onedrive_file_crew import OneDriveFileTrigger
    
    crew = OneDriveFileTrigger().crew()
    crew.kickoff({
        "crewai_trigger_payload": onedrive_payload,
    })
    

The crew inspects file metadata, user activity, and permission changes to produce a compliance-friendly summary.

## 

​

Testing Locally

Test your OneDrive trigger integration locally using the CrewAI CLI:
    
    
    # View all available triggers
    crewai triggers list
    
    # Simulate a OneDrive trigger with realistic payload
    crewai triggers run microsoft_onedrive/file_changed
    

The `crewai triggers run` command will execute your crew with a complete OneDrive payload, allowing you to test your parsing logic before deployment.

Use `crewai triggers run microsoft_onedrive/file_changed` (not `crewai run`) to simulate trigger execution during development. After deployment, your crew will automatically receive the trigger payload.

## 

​

Troubleshooting

  * Ensure the connected account has permission to read the file metadata included in the webhook
  * Test locally with `crewai triggers run microsoft_onedrive/file_changed` to see the exact payload structure
  * If the trigger fires but the payload is missing `permissions`, confirm the site-level sharing settings allow Graph to return this field
  * For large tenants, filter notifications upstream so the crew only runs on relevant directories
  * Remember: use `crewai triggers run` (not `crewai run`) to simulate trigger execution
