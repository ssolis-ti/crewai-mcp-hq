# Webhook Automation


Automate CrewAI AMP workflows using webhooks with platforms like ActivePieces, Zapier, and Make.com


CrewAI AMP allows you to automate your workflow using webhooks. This article will guide you through the process of setting up and using webhooks to kickoff your crew execution, with a focus on integration with ActivePieces, a workflow automation platform similar to Zapier and Make.com.

## 

​

Setting Up Webhooks

1

Accessing the Kickoff Interface

  * Navigate to the CrewAI AMP dashboard
  * Look for the `/kickoff` section, which is used to start the crew execution

2

Configuring the JSON Content

In the JSON Content section, you’ll need to provide the following information:

  * **inputs** : A JSON object containing:
    * `company`: The name of the company (e.g., “tesla”)
    * `product_name`: The name of the product (e.g., “crewai”)
    * `form_response`: The type of response (e.g., “financial”)
    * `icp_description`: A brief description of the Ideal Customer Profile
    * `product_description`: A short description of the product
    * `taskWebhookUrl`, `stepWebhookUrl`, `crewWebhookUrl`: URLs for various webhook endpoints (ActivePieces, Zapier, Make.com or another compatible platform)

Integrating with ActivePieces

In this example we will be using ActivePieces. You can use other platforms such as Zapier and Make.comTo integrate with ActivePieces:

  1. Set up a new flow in ActivePieces
  2. Add a trigger (e.g., `Every Day` schedule)

![ActivePieces Trigger](https://mintcdn.com/crewai/5SZbe87tsCWZY09V/images/enterprise/activepieces-trigger.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=5SZbe87tsCWZY09V&q=85&s=1a52fc1bb47bef6228955360d00f190f)

  3. Add an HTTP action step
     * Set the action to `Send HTTP request`
     * Use `POST` as the method
     * Set the URL to your CrewAI AMP kickoff endpoint
     * Add necessary headers (e.g., `Bearer Token`)

![ActivePieces Headers](https://mintcdn.com/crewai/5SZbe87tsCWZY09V/images/enterprise/activepieces-headers.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=5SZbe87tsCWZY09V&q=85&s=602a5ed1aa2b462b0a81a122a5e2d35f)

     * In the body, include the JSON content as configured in step 2

![ActivePieces Body](https://mintcdn.com/crewai/5SZbe87tsCWZY09V/images/enterprise/activepieces-body.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=5SZbe87tsCWZY09V&q=85&s=f238e1630f7be667cce2d208315ddc75)

     * The crew will then kickoff at the pre-defined time.

Setting Up the Webhook

  1. Create a new flow in ActivePieces and name it

  2. Add a webhook step as the trigger:
     * Select `Catch Webhook` as the trigger type
     * This will generate a unique URL that will receive HTTP requests and trigger your flow

![ActivePieces Webhook](https://mintcdn.com/crewai/5SZbe87tsCWZY09V/images/enterprise/activepieces-webhook.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=5SZbe87tsCWZY09V&q=85&s=8236fd9a97149eff4fd86f1c9a9b0f1a)

     * Configure the email to use crew webhook body text

![ActivePieces Email](https://mintcdn.com/crewai/5SZbe87tsCWZY09V/images/enterprise/activepieces-email.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=5SZbe87tsCWZY09V&q=85&s=484c8d88ed96322d21894e9663f5fc4a)
