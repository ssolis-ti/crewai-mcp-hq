Agent Apps (Integrations)

Connect enterprise‑grade applications (e.g., Gmail, Google Drive, HubSpot, Slack) via OAuth to enable agent actions.

1

Connect

Click **Connect** on an app and complete OAuth.

2

Configure

Optionally adjust scopes, triggers, and action availability.

3

Use in Agents

Connected services become available as tools for your agents.

### 

​

Connect your Account

  1. Go to [Integrations](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/connectors)
  2. Click **Connect** on the desired service
  3. Complete the OAuth flow and grant scopes
  4. Copy your Enterprise Token from [Integration Settings](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/settings/integrations)

![Enterprise Token](https://mintcdn.com/crewai/5SZbe87tsCWZY09V/images/enterprise/enterprise_action_auth_token.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=5SZbe87tsCWZY09V&q=85&s=4e7388bcb76f3f8aa6c6802dd0a98956)

### 

​

Install Integration Tools

To use the integrations locally, you need to install the latest `crewai-tools` package.
    
    
    uv add crewai-tools
    

### 

​

Environment Variable Setup

To use integrations with `Agent(apps=[])`, you must set the `CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` environment variable with your Enterprise Token.
    
    
    export CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN="your_enterprise_token"
    

Or add it to your `.env` file:
    
    
    CREWAI_PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=your_enterprise_token
    

### 

​

Usage Example

Use the new streamlined approach to integrate enterprise apps. Simply specify the app and its actions directly in the Agent configuration.
    
    
    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
    
    # Create an agent with Gmail capabilities
    email_agent = Agent(
        role="Email Manager",
        goal="Manage and organize email communications",
        backstory="An AI assistant specialized in email management and communication.",
        apps=['gmail', 'gmail/send_email']  # Using canonical name 'gmail'
    )
    
    # Task to send an email
    email_task = Task(
        description="Draft and send a follow-up email to john@example.com about the project update",
        agent=email_agent,
        expected_output="Confirmation that email was sent successfully"
    )
    
    # Run the task
    crew = Crew(
        agents=[email_agent],
        tasks=[email_task]
    )
    
    # Run the crew
    crew.kickoff()
    

### 

​

Filtering Tools
    
    
    from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
    
    # Create agent with specific Gmail actions only
    gmail_agent = Agent(
        role="Gmail Manager",
        goal="Manage gmail communications and notifications",
        backstory="An AI assistant that helps coordinate gmail communications.",
        apps=['gmail/fetch_emails']  # Using canonical name with specific action
    )
    
    notification_task = Task(
        description="Find the email from john@example.com",
        agent=gmail_agent,
        expected_output="Email found from john@example.com"
    )
    
    crew = Crew(
        agents=[gmail_agent],
        tasks=[notification_task]
    )
    

On a deployed crew, you can specify which actions are available for each integration from the service settings page.

![Filter Actions](https://mintcdn.com/crewai/Tp3HEbbp9mp-dy3H/images/enterprise/filtering_enterprise_action_tools.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=Tp3HEbbp9mp-dy3H&q=85&s=2e689397eabeacd23d0c226ff40566fd)

### 

​

Scoped Deployments (multi‑user orgs)

You can scope each integration to a specific user. For example, a crew that connects to Google can use a specific user’s Gmail account.

Useful when different teams/users must keep data access separated.

Use the `user_bearer_token` to scope authentication to the requesting user. If the user isn’t logged in, the crew won’t use connected integrations. Otherwise it falls back to the default bearer token configured for the deployment.
