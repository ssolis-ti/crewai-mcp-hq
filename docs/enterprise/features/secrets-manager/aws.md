# AWS Secrets Manager (Static Credentials)


Configure AWS Secrets Manager as a secret provider for CrewAI Platform using static access keys or AssumeRole


## 

​

Overview

This guide walks you through configuring AWS Secrets Manager as a secret provider for your CrewAI Platform organization, using **static credentials** (access keys, optionally with AssumeRole). By the end, CrewAI Platform will be able to read secrets stored in your AWS account and inject them as environment variable values at runtime.

This guide covers the **static credentials** path — secrets are resolved at deploy time and baked into the deployment image. Rotated values require a re-deploy. If you want rotation-aware secrets that update on every automation kickoff (no re-deploy), see [AWS Workload Identity (OIDC Federation)](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/aws-workload-identity).

This guide covers the AWS-side configuration and the credential setup in CrewAI Platform. To then reference a secret from an environment variable, see [Using the Secrets Manager](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/usage).

## 

​

Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

  * An AWS account with permission to create IAM users, customer-managed policies, and (optionally) IAM roles.
  * The AWS region where your secrets live (or will live), for example `us-east-1`.
  * A CrewAI Platform organization where your user has the `secret_providers: manage` permission. See [Permissions (RBAC)](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/usage#permissions-rbac).

## 

​

Choose an Authentication Method

CrewAI Platform supports two ways for the platform to authenticate with AWS Secrets Manager. Pick one before you begin — the steps below differ depending on which you choose.

Method| When to use| Trade-offs  
---|---|---  
**Static access keys**|  Getting started, single-account deployments| Simplest setup; access keys must be rotated manually  
**AssumeRole**|  Cross-account, production hardening| Short-lived credentials; supports External ID; requires extra IAM role  
  
The rest of this guide uses tabs in Steps 3–5 so you can follow the path that matches your choice.

## 

​

Step 1 — Create an IAM User

Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), navigate to **Users** , then click **Create user**.

  * Suggested name: `crewai-secrets-reader`.
  * Leave **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console** unchecked — this principal is used programmatically by CrewAI Platform, not by humans.
  * Click **Next**.

On the **Set permissions** page, leave the default selection. You will attach the policy in Step 3. Click **Next** , review, and click **Create user**. For full details, see the AWS documentation: [Create an IAM user in your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

## 

​

Step 2 — Create the IAM Policy

CrewAI Platform needs read-only access to AWS Secrets Manager and permission to decrypt secrets via KMS. Create a customer-managed policy with the following JSON. In the IAM console, navigate to **Policies** , then click **Create policy**. Choose the **JSON** tab and replace the contents with:
    
    
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "SecretsManagerRead",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
            "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
            "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
          "Sid": "KMSDecrypt",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
            "kms:DescribeKey",
            "kms:Decrypt"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
        }
      ]
    }
    

Click **Next** , then on the **Review and create** page:

  * **Policy name:** `CrewAISecretsManagerRead`
  * **Description (optional):** `Read-only access to AWS Secrets Manager for CrewAI Platform`

Click **Create policy**.

The policy above grants `*` on `Resource` for simplicity. In production, scope the `Resource` down to the ARNs of the specific secrets CrewAI Platform should access, and scope `kms:Decrypt` to the specific KMS key ARNs that encrypt those secrets. See the [AWS guidance on least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html).

## 

​

Step 3 — Attach the Policy

  * Static access keys

  * AssumeRole

  1. In the IAM console, navigate to **Users** and click the user you created in Step 1.
  2. On the **Permissions** tab, click **Add permissions** → **Attach policies directly**.
  3. Search for `CrewAISecretsManagerRead`, select it, and click **Next**.
  4. Click **Add permissions**.

With AssumeRole, the policy is attached to a separate IAM **role** (not directly to the user). The user from Step 1 only needs permission to call `sts:AssumeRole` on that role.**Create the role:**

  1. In the IAM console, navigate to **Roles** and click **Create role**.
  2. **Trusted entity type:** AWS account. Choose **This account** (or **Another AWS account** for cross-account setups, then enter the AWS account ID hosting the IAM user from Step 1).
  3. (Recommended) Check **Require external ID** and enter a value you generate yourself — this is a shared secret you will paste into CrewAI Platform in Step 5.
  4. Click **Next**.
  5. Attach the `CrewAISecretsManagerRead` policy.
  6. Click **Next** , name the role `CrewAISecretsManagerRole`, and click **Create role**.

**Allow the IAM user to assume the role:**

  1. Open the role you just created and copy its **ARN**.
  2. In the IAM console, navigate to **Users** , click the user from Step 1, and on the **Permissions** tab click **Add permissions** → **Create inline policy**.
  3. On the **JSON** tab, paste the following (replace `ROLE_ARN_FROM_ABOVE`):

    
    
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Resource": "ROLE_ARN_FROM_ABOVE"
        }
      ]
    }
    

  4. Name the policy `CrewAIAssumeSecretsRole` and click **Create policy**.

## 

​

Step 4 — Get Credentials

  * Static access keys

  * AssumeRole

  1. In the IAM console, open the user from Step 1.
  2. Click the **Security credentials** tab.
  3. Under **Access keys** , click **Create access key**.
  4. Select **Application running outside AWS** (or **Other**) as the use case. Click **Next**.
  5. (Optional) Add a description tag. Click **Create access key**.
  6. Click **Show** to reveal the secret access key, then copy both the **Access key ID** and the **Secret access key** , or click **Download .csv file**.

The secret access key is shown only once. If you close this page without copying it, you will need to delete the key and create a new one.

For full details, see the AWS documentation: [Manage access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

Even with AssumeRole, CrewAI Platform still needs an access key for the IAM user — it uses those keys as the calling identity to perform the `sts:AssumeRole` call.

  1. Create an access key for the user exactly as described in the **Static access keys** tab above.
  2. Open the role you created in Step 3 and copy:
     * The **Role ARN** (from the role summary).
     * The **External ID** you configured (if any) — you set this yourself in Step 3, so make sure you have it on hand.

## 

​

Step 5 — Add the Credential in CrewAI Platform

In CrewAI Platform, navigate to **Settings** → **Secret Provider Credentials** and click **Add Credential**.

  * Static access keys

  * AssumeRole

Fill the form:

  * **Name:** A descriptive name, e.g. `aws-prod`.
  * **Provider:** `AWS Secrets Manager`.
  * **Region:** The AWS region where your secrets live, e.g. `us-east-1`. This must match the region of the secrets you want to read.
  * **Access Key ID:** The value from Step 4.
  * **Secret Access Key:** The value from Step 4.
  * (Optional) Check **Set as default credential for this provider**. The default credential is used by environment variables that reference AWS secrets without specifying a credential explicitly.

Leave **Role ARN** and **External ID** blank.Click **Create**.

Fill the form:

  * **Name:** A descriptive name, e.g. `aws-prod-assumerole`.
  * **Provider:** `AWS Secrets Manager`.
  * **Region:** The AWS region where your secrets live.
  * **Access Key ID:** The IAM user’s access key from Step 4 (used to call STS).
  * **Secret Access Key:** The IAM user’s secret access key from Step 4.
  * **Role ARN:** The Role ARN you copied in Step 4.
  * **External ID:** The External ID you set on the role’s trust policy (omit if none).
  * (Optional) Check **Set as default credential for this provider**.

Click **Create**.

**How the two modes behave at runtime:**

  * With **static access keys** only, CrewAI Platform calls AWS Secrets Manager directly using the keys you supplied.
  * When a **Role ARN** is set, CrewAI Platform first calls `sts:AssumeRole` with the supplied access keys (and External ID if configured), then uses the short-lived credentials returned by STS to read your secrets.

## 

​

Step 6 — Create at Least One Secret in AWS

If you do not already have secrets in AWS Secrets Manager, create one now so you can verify the connection in Step 7. In the [AWS Secrets Manager console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/), click **Store a new secret**.

  * **Secret type:** Choose **Other type of secret**.
  * **Key/value pairs** — either:
    * Enter one or more key/value pairs (recommended for structured secrets), or
    * Use the **Plaintext** tab for a single string value.
  * **Encryption key:** Use `aws/secretsmanager` (the AWS-managed key) unless you have a specific KMS key requirement.

Click **Next** , then enter:

  * **Secret name:** A unique name, e.g. `crewai/openai-api-key`.
  * **Description (optional):** A short note about what the secret is for.

Click **Next** through the rotation and review steps, then click **Store**.

**JSON-key reference syntax.** If you store a secret with multiple key/value pairs (a JSON object), CrewAI Platform can extract a specific field using the `secret-name#json_key` syntax in environment variable references. For example, a secret named `database-credentials` with `{"username": "...", "password": "..."}` can be referenced as `database-credentials#password`. See [Using the Secrets Manager](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/usage#referencing-secrets-in-environment-variables) for details.

For full details, see the AWS documentation: [Create an AWS Secrets Manager secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/create_secret.html).

## 

​

Step 7 — Test the Connection

Back in CrewAI Platform, on the **Secret Provider Credentials** page, find the credential you just created and click **Test Connection**. A success toast confirms that CrewAI Platform can authenticate to AWS and read secrets from your account. If the test fails, check the most common causes:

Symptom| Likely cause  
---|---  
`AccessDenied` on `secretsmanager:ListSecrets`| Policy not attached, or wrong user. Re-check Step 3.  
`AccessDenied` on `kms:Decrypt`| Missing the `KMSDecrypt` statement, or your secrets use a customer-managed KMS key not covered by `Resource: "*"`.  
`InvalidClientTokenId` / `SignatureDoesNotMatch`| Wrong access key ID or secret access key. Re-check Step 4 and Step 5.  
`RegionDisabledException` / no secrets found| The credential’s **Region** does not match where your secrets actually live.  
`AccessDenied` on `sts:AssumeRole` (AssumeRole only)| Inline `sts:AssumeRole` policy missing on the IAM user, or the role’s trust policy does not allow this principal, or the External ID does not match.  
Test passes immediately after creating the IAM user, but fails next time| IAM credentials sometimes take a minute or two to propagate globally. Retry.

Next Steps

Now that AWS is connected, head to [Using the Secrets Manager](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/usage) to:

  * Grant org members the right permissions to use (or manage) Secrets Manager.
  * Reference your AWS secrets from CrewAI Platform environment variables.

If you want **rotation-aware** secrets that propagate without re-deploying, switch to [AWS Workload Identity (OIDC Federation)](/en/enterprise/features/secrets-manager/aws-workload-identity) — same secret store, no static credentials, secrets are fetched per kickoff.
