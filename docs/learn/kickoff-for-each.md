# Kickoff Crew for Each


Kickoff Crew for Each Item in a List


## 

​

Introduction

CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew for each item in a list, allowing you to execute the crew for each item in the list. This feature is particularly useful when you need to perform the same set of tasks for multiple items.

Kicking Off a Crew for Each Item

To kickoff a crew for each item in a list, use the `kickoff_for_each()` method. This method executes the crew for each item in the list, allowing you to process multiple items efficiently. Here’s an example of how to kickoff a crew for each item in a list:

Code
    
    
    from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task
    
    # Create an agent with code execution enabled
    coding_agent = Agent(
        role="Python Data Analyst",
        goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
        backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
        allow_code_execution=True
    )
    
    # Create a task that requires code execution
    data_analysis_task = Task(
        description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
        agent=coding_agent,
        expected_output="The average age calculated from the dataset"
    )
    
    # Create a crew and add the task
    analysis_crew = Crew(
        agents=[coding_agent],
        tasks=[data_analysis_task],
        verbose=True,
        memory=False
    )
    
    datasets = [
      { "ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45] },
      { "ages": [20, 25, 30, 35, 40] },
      { "ages": [30, 35, 40, 45, 50] }
    ]
    
    # Execute the crew
    result = analysis_crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=datasets)
